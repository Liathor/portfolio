        <p>My name is Misha Dyer, I'm new to coding, but very eager to learn and apply my skills. I'm from a book publishing background, wherein I work with data management of book products as well as ebook production. I have experience with XML, HTML and CSS as a result of my background in publishing. The EDX bootcamp is giving me a greater understanding of HTML and CSS, and has also introduced me to Javascript.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy hiking, reading gaming and escape rooms. Please reach out to me if you have any questions. I'm happy to answer and chat.</p>
